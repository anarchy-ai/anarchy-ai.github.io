# Mission

We're on a mission to democratize AI at whatever the cost. We're hackers who've grown tired of AI safety rhetoric meaning locked-down APIs with inconsistent support.

### Our promises
- We will move towards open-source, not away from it.
- We will work to accelerate the commoditization of AI.
- We will not judge your use-cases (provided it is legal).

### Our mission corralaries
- All else equal, open-source is better.
- The world needs more intelligence.
- Weâ€™re here to help each other and build for builders.
- Quality comes from community.
- Technology is good and should be good.
- Hackers need freedom
- Hackers need information
- Write malleable code
- Build simple interfaces

### How will we make money?

We are working to provide managed model hosting and training infrastructure for both developers and enterprises.
