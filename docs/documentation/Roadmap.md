# Roadmap

### [LLM-VM](https://github.com/Anarchy-AI/LLM-VM)

The LLM-VM is an LLM agnostic JIT for natural language.  Specifically, it uses LLMs to convert conversational natural language into a dynamic series of LLM and IO commands.
You provide the underlying provider(s), actions (APIs, code-hooks) and their descriptions, data-sources (PDFs, websites...), and the LLM-VM will take care of load-balancing, fine-tuning, natural language compilation and tool-selection.

### [chat.dev](https://chat.dev/)

This is our managed hosting service for the LLM-VM.  Here you can create an optimized LLM endpoint with access to your APIs and data.
