# Careers

### Have what it takes to create anarchy?
Do you love to build? Do you have the creativity and tenacity to solve hard problems? If so, reach out! We're always looking for serious hackers to join our cause.

### Our Work Values
- Always be on the lookout for opportunities to be helpful
- Truth comes from discourse.
- Every side has a grain of truth (in non-technical discussions).  You just don't know everybody's language.  You're aim should be to learn.
- Be honest.
- Just do things and many things, but do them well.
- Don’t ask for permission.
- Don’t be mad if somebody does a thing  without asking permission.  Next time make sure the auths are correct.
- A product shouldn't tell somebody they can't do something, but it's okay to tell them they shouldn't.
- Code should be simple and short.
- Code duplication is the root of all evil.
- Ask many questions.
- Ask open-ended questions.
- Don’t be the first person to critique an idea.
- Critique your own idea first, and publicly.
- Every idea is valuable yet somehow terrible.


### Apply
We will pay the best, for the best. The best way to secure a job/internship with us is to submit a pull request that closes a ticket [on our github](https://github.com/anarchy-ai/LLM-VM/issues). The second best way is to submit good tickets. Otherwise, [apply directly here](https://forms.gle/bUWDKW3cwZ8n6qsU8).
